This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.python_pip
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.

  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap

```
